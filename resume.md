# Main

## Patrick Green

I am currently a doctoral candidate at Louisiana Tech University,
pursuing a doctorate in Industrial / Organizational Psychology. I plan
to have my dissertation completed by the end of 2023, if not sooner.
While finishing my Ph.D., I also am interested in pursuing industry
experience, preferably within the areas of People Analytics, Talent
Management, and/or Assessment Development (for selection).

The focus of my academics outside of coursework has been on
psychometrics (e.g., IRT, CAT) and developing assessments for selection.
For example, developing a simplistic Automatic Item Generation numeric
sequence test and my dissertation, which pertains to a situational
judgment test. My interests however, also include talent management,
especially methods of retaining talent. Feel free to reach out to me
with any questions you may have.
