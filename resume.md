# Main

## Patrick Green

I currently am in the final year of pursuing my doctorate in I-O
Psychology at Louisiana Tech University and plan to have my dissertation
completed by the end of 2023, if not sooner. The focus of my academics
outside of coursework has been on Psychometrics (e.g., IRT, CAT),
Development of Assessments, and Selection. For example, developing a
simplistic Automatic Item Generation numeric sequence test in PHP or my
dissertation which is on a novel method of scoring situational judgment
tests used in selecting project managers.

My interests however, also include talent management and acquisition,
with an emphasis on methods to improve retention. Looking forward, I am
also interested in pursuing experiences that will provide an opportunity
to gain industry experience while also providing a flexible environment
that allows for me to finish up my dissertation. Feel free to reach out
to me with any questions you may have.
